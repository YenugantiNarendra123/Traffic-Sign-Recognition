1. Project Overview
   The project involves building a Traffic Sign Recognition system using Deep Learning to classify 43 types of traffic signs accurately.
   The primary objective is to enhance road safety by enabling vehicles or systems to detect and interpret traffic signs in real-time.
   
2. Dataset
   Dataset Used: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB).
   Structure:
   Train Folder: 43 subdirectories (classes) labeled 0â€“42 with varying numbers of images per class.
   Test Folder: Contains test images for model evaluation.
   Meta Data: Includes additional information for mapping labels to traffic sign descriptions.
   Image Format: PNG.
   Dataset Size: Over 50,000 images of traffic signs with varying shapes, sizes, and conditions.
